#CS106B
#Preface:
In order to learn c++ deeply, I manage to finish the assignments of CS106B and push them here with the hope of interacting and discussing with others.If you need learning resources of CS106B, it's my pleasure to contact with you.
#Assignment 2:
It's amzing for me to find that programming isn't something that departed from reality.When I learned programming in my own school, I was just asked to figure out what these algorithms are but didn't know why and how to use them. But when I finish this assignment, I find that just codiing is mindless, analysis of pros and cons of this tool and methods to put it into use are more important. I'm keen on this way to learn knowledge and improve my ability of soving problems in real world. Thanks to CS106B, I almost always become happier after programming in this way.And I will manage to realise my dream of text combined with AI.
